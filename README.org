#+TITLE: Typst Mode

Note: I'm a Emacs lisp newbie, and this is my first package. I really appreciate your help(issues, pull requests and etc.)!

An Emacs major mode for [[https://typst.app/][typst]] markup-based typesetting system.

Since the language style of =typst= is somewhat complicated to parse(at least for me), this package currently only provide limited syntax highlighting feature :(. Maybe complicated cases should be implemented into lsp server?

* To Dos
1. [ ] math mode need fix

* Current Shortages
For those stuffs cannot be done in short future.
1. no syntax support for the context block =[ ]= which is located in the code block ={ }= \\
   this problem possibly can be solved with *nested polymode*. However, currently there is no official support for this function?

* To Dos
1. [ ] add treesit mode
2. [ ] support inner math
3. [ ] code block highlight
